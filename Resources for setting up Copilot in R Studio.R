# Copilot is a tool that uses AI to help you write code. It's now available 
# for use with the R coding language and can be used within R Studio.

# The links below are resources that may be references during the GSS presention
# on this topic and were helpful for setting up Copilot for R.

# Not necessary for Copilot, but if you're new to Github and looking for instructions
# for how to set up version control so you can backup your work with Github 
# (by the end, you'll know exactly how to commit, push and pull!), I highly
# recommend this bookdown resource called "Happy Git and Github for the useR"
